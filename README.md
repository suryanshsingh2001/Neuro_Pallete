## Usage:

To get started with NeuroPalette, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/suryanshsingh2001/Neuro_Pallete.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install` on both `client` and `server`.
3. Create a new `.env` file in the `server` folder of the project.
4. Set up the required API credentials by adding the following lines to the `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="<open_api_key>"
MONGODB_URL="<mongodb_url>"

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="<cloudinary_cloud_name>"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="<cloudinary_api_key>"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="<cloudinary_api_secret>"
```
Make sure to replace `your-openai-api-key`, `your-cloudinary-api-key`, `your-cloudinary-api-secret` and `mongodb_url` with your own API keys obtained from the OpenAI, Cloudinary and Mongodb platforms.

5. Save the `.env` file.
6. Run the application in split terminal for `client` and `server`: `npm run dev` and `npm start` respectively

Please note that without configuring the API keys correctly, the application may not function properly. Ensure that you have valid API keys from OpenAI and Cloudinary to fully utilize the NeuroPalette features.
